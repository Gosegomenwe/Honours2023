# Honours2023
The implementation of my Computer Science Honours project. Submitted on 20 October 2023.


Agriculture plays an important role in the development and sustainability of food security. Optimizing favourable crop growth conditions has become vital with the global warming surge. There are many field and laboratory techniques for classifying soil, but they have drawbacks, including being labour-intensive and time-consuming. Methods such as this provide farmers with instantaneous insight into their land, helping them optimize crop production. This research investigates the use of machine learning to develop a system for classifying soil types. Soil classification divides soil types into classes or groups that share comparable features. This study will attempt to identify different soil textures from images and classify them into eight soil type categories.

Experiment 3 implements the Random Forest Tree, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM and CNN to classify the following soil type images:
Alluvial
Black
Red
Clay
Sand
Silt
Chalky
